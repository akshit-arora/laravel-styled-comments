# Laravel Comment Generator
This is an  (ongoing) effort to make our comments as beautiful as what the OG Taylor Otwell writes on Laravel framework.


**NOTE**: This tool is still in development. It may not work as expected as it's still in a very early stage. You're welcome to contribute to it if you're interested.

## Roadmap

This tool of course has many things to do. I am making it open source so that each on of us can contribute and make the tool better. I am thinking of the following updates.

ðŸ”² As Caleb said on his [Laracon US 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31pBMi0UdYE) speech, we, the devs suck at designing. So foremost thing: Need to make it beautiful.

ðŸ”² Add a `Copy` button to copy the generated comment

ðŸ”² Select the type of comment (`// `, ` /* */` or `| `) for multiple lines

ðŸ”² The generator still gets buggy at times when it adds a new line in the comment.

ðŸ”² Set the variable max-character-per-line
